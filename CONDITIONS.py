print("1) Consist of a large number of particles and be in thermodynamic equilibrium\n"
      "2) Be isotropic (i.e., its properties are the same in all directions)\n"
      "3) Be classical, meaning quantum and relativistic effects are negligible\n"
      "4) Be collision-dominated, meaning that:\n"
      "     - particle interactions occur only when particles are close to each other, and depend solely on their relative positions\n"
      "     - perfectly elastic collisions between particles are allowed\n\n")
